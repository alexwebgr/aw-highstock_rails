# Aw::HighstockRails
[Highstock](https://www.highcharts.com/blog/products/highstock/) lets you create stock or general timeline charts in pure JavaScript with sophisticated navigation options like 
a small navigator series, preset date ranges, date picker, scrolling, and panning. 
This gem includes Highstock as an asset in the Rails 5.1+ asset pipeline. Note: Highstock is not free for commercial use, so you'll need a [valid license](https://shop.highsoft.com/) to use Highstock.

Highstock includes highcharts as well so there is no need to include it in your app.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'aw-highstock_rails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install aw-highstock_rails

## Usage
Just add the following lines to application.js 

    //= require highstock/highstock
    //= require highstock/highcharts-more
    
Add modules if needed 
    
    //= require highstock/modules/solid-gauge
    //= require highstock/modules/exporting
    //= require highstock/modules/offline-exporting
    //= require highstock/modules/export-data
    //= require highstock/modules/xrange
